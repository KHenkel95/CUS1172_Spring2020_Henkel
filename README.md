Summary: This quiz app implements the ability to choose between two quizzes and runs a scoreboard at the top. When a user answers correctly, they receive a positive message and move on to the next question. When a user answers incorrectly, they are given a hint and have to attempt the question again. The app uses a JSON REST API to store the quiz data. The app is a Single Page Application (SPA), which means that everything is loaded at the start and made hidden and visible as needed via CSS properties.
